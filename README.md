# Spring WebFlow Analyzer

# Introduction : 

Spring Web Flow (SWF) is the sub-project of the Spring Framework that focuses on providing the infrastructure for building and running rich web applications. The project tries to solve 3 core problems facing web application developers:
* How do you express page navigation rules?
* How do you manage navigation and conversational state?
* How do you facilitate modularization and reuse?

In Spring Web Flow, a web flow answers all of the above questions: it captures navigational rules allowing the Spring Web Flow execution engine to manage a conversation and the associated state. At the same time, a web flow is a reusable web application module.

This technical package is deliver "as-is". It has been used in a limited number of situations.
This package has been tested in CAST 8.1.x
